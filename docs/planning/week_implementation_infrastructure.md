# UAV Infrastructure Inspection VQA - 7-Day Implementation Plan

## Day 1-2: Infrastructure-Specific Prompt Templates

### Create: `vqasynth/infrastructure_prompts.py`

```python
INFRASTRUCTURE_INSPECTION_PROMPTS = {
    "damage_assessment": [
        "What type of structural damage is visible in this {structure_type}?",
        "Rate the condition of this {component} from 1-10, where 10 is perfect condition.",
        "Are there any signs of wear, corrosion, or deterioration visible?",
        "What maintenance issues can you identify in this inspection image?",
    ],
    
    "safety_evaluation": [
        "Is this {structure_type} safe for continued use?",
        "What safety hazards are present in this infrastructure?",
        "Does this structure require immediate attention or repairs?",
        "Are there any code violations visible in this construction?",
    ],
    
    "component_specific": {
        "bridge": [
            "What is the condition of the bridge joints and connections?",
            "Are there any signs of concrete spalling or rebar exposure?",
            "Is the bridge deck surface in good condition?",
        ],
        "power_lines": [
            "Are all power line conductors properly tensioned?",
            "Are there any damaged insulators visible?",
            "Is vegetation clearance adequate around power lines?",
        ],
        "building": [
            "What is the condition of the roof and gutters?",
            "Are there any missing or damaged building materials?",
            "Is the building envelope weathertight?",
        ]
    }
}

INFRASTRUCTURE_TAGS = [
    "Bridge", "Power Lines", "Building Facade", "Solar Panels", 
    "Infrastructure", "Construction", "Maintenance", "Inspection",
    "Structural", "Industrial", "Utilities", "Transportation"
]
```

## Day 3-4: Spatial Reasoning for Infrastructure

### Modify: `vqasynth/localize.py` 
Add infrastructure-specific spatial understanding:

```python
def assess_infrastructure_condition(self, image, structure_type):
    """Enhanced spatial reasoning for infrastructure inspection"""
    
    # Detect structural elements
    elements = self.detect_structural_elements(image, structure_type)
    
    # Assess condition using spatial relationships
    condition_assessment = {}
    for element in elements:
        condition = self.evaluate_element_condition(element)
        condition_assessment[element['type']] = condition
    
    return condition_assessment

def generate_inspection_questions(self, elements, condition_assessment):
    """Generate targeted inspection questions based on detected issues"""
    questions = []
    
    for element_type, condition in condition_assessment.items():
        if condition['score'] < 7:  # Poor condition
            questions.append(f"What repair is needed for the {element_type}?")
        if condition['has_damage']:
            questions.append(f"How severe is the damage to the {element_type}?")
    
    return questions
```

## Day 5-6: Generate Infrastructure Dataset

### Create evaluation dataset:
- 200-300 infrastructure images
- Bridge inspections, building facades, power lines
- Generate 1000+ inspection-focused VQA pairs
- Include damage severity ratings, safety assessments

## Day 7: Results Analysis

### Metrics to measure:
- Inspection accuracy vs general VQA models
- Safety-critical question answering performance  
- Domain expert evaluation of generated questions
- Comparison with human inspector assessments

## Expected Conference Paper Results:

1. **Novel Dataset:** First large-scale infrastructure inspection VQA dataset
2. **Performance Gains:** 15-25% improvement in infrastructure-specific questions
3. **Practical Impact:** Demonstrated cost savings for inspection workflows
4. **Industry Validation:** Feedback from infrastructure inspection companies

## Implementation Commands:

```bash
# Update config for infrastructure focus
cp config/config.yaml config/config_infrastructure.yaml

# Modify tags for infrastructure scenarios
# Run infrastructure-specific pipeline
docker compose -f pipelines/infrastructure_inspection.yaml up --build

# Generate evaluation metrics
python evaluate_infrastructure_vqa.py
```
