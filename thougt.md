A drone flies into an unkown environment

#RGBD

Maps the environment, layout and and thing therein using some classical or foundation model based SLAM Like say MAST3R-SLAM

with that we could get the semantic understanding of the layout and items for indoors - SpatialLM 
    `
    #RGB
Maps the environment by using camera or just record the video of the environment if real time inference with VGGT/VGGT-Long is not feasible

with that we could get the semantic understanding of the layout and items for indoors - SpatialLM 

VQA based - Spatial perception
